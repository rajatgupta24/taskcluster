title: Pulse
---

Taskcluster uses RabbitMQ to communicate between microservices.
The particular approach it takes to this communication is called "Pulse", taken from a larger project at Mozilla, but it can run against any RabbitMQ deployment, either local or hosted by a commercial provider.

See [the Pulse design page](/docs/manual/design/apis/pulse) for information on how Taskcluster expects this to be configured.
This is satisfied by a mostly-default RabbitMQ installation.

## Configuration

The following Helm configuration properties must be set, and are shared by all services:

* `pulseHostname` - hostname of the Pulse server.  This must be listening on the amqps or amqp port.
* `pulseVhost` - vhost on which Taskcluster should communicate.  Taskcluster will create some exchanges and queues with fixed names (`exchange/taskcluster-<service>/*` and `queue/taskcluster-<service>/*`) in this vhost.

Services that use Pulse require service-specific credentials for access to Pulse.
These are defined by the configuration Helm properties `<service>.pulse_username` and `<service>.pulse_password`.
Each such user should have the following permissions in the vhost configured with `pulseVhost`:

* **configure**: `^(queue/taskcluster\-<service>/.*|exchange/taskcluster\-<service>/.*)`
* **write**: `^(queue/taskcluster\-<service>/.*|exchange/taskcluster\-<service>/.*)`
* **read**: `^(queue/taskcluster\-<service>/.*|exchange/.*)`

Adherence to the Pulse naming conventions means that the `<service>.pulse_username` Helm property should have value `taskcluster-<service>`, and this is the recommended approach on a dedicated Pulse server.
However, Taskcluster does not require that this be the case and will use any username it is given.

### Server Configuration Details

Taskcluster is particularly sensitive to the AMQP `frame_max` parameter.
It must fit all the "routes" for a task into the header of an AMQP message, and the header must fit in a single frame.
RabbitMQ's default frame_max is 128k, and other AMQP servers should be configured similarly.
