# Matrix Integration

Taskcluster requires a Matrix client in order to be able to post notices to Matrix.

## Client Setup

This can differ depending on how you're setting things up but if you are using Element,
[this helpful site](https://t2bot.io/docs/access_tokens/) has given nice instructions
which we'll copy here for posterity:

0. In a private/incognito browser window, open Element.
0. Log in to the account you want to get the access token for, such as the bot's account.
0. Click on the bot's name in the top left corner then "Settings".
0. (Optional) Set your bot's display name and avatar.
0. Click the "Help & About" tab (left side of the dialog).
0. Scroll to the bottom and click the &lt;click to reveal> part of Access Token: &lt;click to reveal>.
0. Copy your access token to a safe place, like the bot's configuration file.
0. Do not log out. Instead, just close the window. If you used a private browsing session, you should be able to still use Element for your own account. Logging out deletes the access token from the server, making the bot unable to use it.

## Taskcluster Configuration

In the Helm templates, you'll need to set

```yaml
# The homeserver URL where your client is registered
notify.matrix_base_url: https://mozilla.modular.im
# The user that will act on behalf of taskcluster
notify.matrix_user_id: @my-taskcluster-bot:mozilla.org
# The access token for this user, generated above
notify.matrix_access_token: secretsecrets
```
