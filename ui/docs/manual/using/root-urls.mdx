import SiteSpecific from '@taskcluster/ui/components/SiteSpecific';

Every Taskcluster deployment is identified by a "Root URL", which is used to interact with the deployment.

<SiteSpecific>
The root URL for this deployment is `%root_url%`.
</SiteSpecific>
<SiteSpecific showIfNotSet={['root_url']}>
The Firefox CI deployment is publicly viewable, and you are welcome to explore it.
Its root URL is https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com.
</SiteSpecific>

Loading a deployment's root URL in a browser presents the Taskcluster user interface, but other paths on this URL lead to documentation, APIs, schemas, and other resources.

See the ["URL Structure" reference](/docs/reference/url-structure) for more information.
