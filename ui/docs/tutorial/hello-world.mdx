# Hello, World

Let's start by seeing Taskcluster in action.

## Finding Taskcluster

Taskcluster is an application that organizations deploy to serve their needs, so following this portion of the tutorial might require some assistance from the people responsible for your deployment.
The first thing you will need to know is the URL of the deployment (called a "[root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls)").

<SiteSpecific>
The root URL for this deployment is `%root_url%`.
</SiteSpecific>
<SiteSpecific showIfNotSet={['root_url']}>
See [Finding a Taskcluster Deployment](/docs/tutorial/finding-tc) for help getting a root URL.
</SiteSpecific>

## Signing In

Once you've determined the rootUrl for your deployment, you'll need to visit it in a browser and click the "sign in" link.
Sign in using whatever method best suits you.

## Finding a Worker Pool

Once you're signed in, you will need to figure out which, if any, worker pools you have permission to run tasks in.
Click the userpic in the upper-right corner and choose "Account", and look for scopes beginning with `queue:create-task:`.
These represent permissions to run tasks.
Look for one that seems general-purpose, or ask the folks who administer your deployment.
For example, you might see `queue:create-task:highest:proj-misc/tutorial`.
This grants access to workerPool `proj-misc/tutorial`.
If possible, choose one that is running docker-worker.

<SiteSpecific>
In this deployment, `%tutorial_worker_pool_id%` is a good choice.
</SiteSpecific>

## Creating a Task

Now that you've got a worker pool in mind, go to "Create a task" on the navigation menu.
What you see in the resulting text box is a bare-bones task description, looking something like this (the details may evolve as features are added):

```yaml
taskQueueId: some/worker-pool
created: '2020-09-27T15:24:45.442Z'
deadline: '2020-09-27T18:24:45.443Z'
payload:
  image: 'ubuntu:latest'
  command:
    - /bin/bash
    - '-c'
    - for ((i=1;i<=60;i++)); do echo $i; sleep 1; done
  maxRunTime: 90
metadata:
  name: Example Task
  description: Markdown description of **what** this task does
  owner: name@example.com
  source: 'https://github.com/username/repo'
```

Happily, this is already set up to print "hello world"!
Update the `taskQueueId` according to your discoveries above (the same as the `workerPoolId`).
Submitting the task will load the task inspector while the task is scheduled and run.

The fields in the task description are explained in greater detail throughout the rest of this documentation, but briefly:

 * `taskQueueId` identifies the Taskcluster queue for the task, connected to the pool of workers that will execute the task.

 * `created` and `deadline` give a time boundary for the task.
   If the task is not completed by its deadline, it will be resolved as `exception` with reason `"deadline-exceeded"`.

 * The `payload` is interpreted by the Docker worker.
   The `image` key specifies the docker image to pull, and the `command` gives the command to run within that image.

In the task inspector, you will see your task description as executed, and indications of the task's status: pending, executing, and then finished.

The log view shows the output of the task, including that from downloading the docker image.
Following that, you should see "live" output of the for loop counting up to 600.

You've run your first task!
