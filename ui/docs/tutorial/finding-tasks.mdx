# Finding Tasks

The "table of contents" for Taskcluster tasks is the "task index".
That's a good place to start looking for real tasks.

The task index browser is available in the navigation sidebar of the Taskcluster web interface.
The precise format of the index paths depends on the tasks being run on the Taskcluster deployment you are looking at.

<SiteSpecific>
For this deployment, you can browse the root of the index [here](%root_url%/tasks/index).

The [Firefox-CI deployment](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com) of Taskcluster has lots of tasks.
For example, as of this writing the latest builds of Firefox are at index path [gecko.v2.mozilla-release.latest.firefox](https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/index/gecko.v2.mozilla-release.latest.firefox).
See [Finding a Taskcluster Deployment](/docs/tutorial/finding-tc) for help finding other deployments.

## Details

Here's how it works.
When a task completes successfully, it is added to the index at an "index route" given by any `task.routes` entries that begin with `index.`.
(Actually, the Queue just [sends pulse messages to well-known exchanges](/docs/reference/platform/queue/exchanges).
The Index listens to `index.*` for task completion, and indexes the tasks appropriately).
Newer index entries overwrite older, allowing index paths like `latest` to always link to the most recent task.
