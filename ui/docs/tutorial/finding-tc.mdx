This tutorial is most useful if you have a Taskcluster deployment to work with.
Taskcluster deployments are identified by their [root URL](/docs/manual/using/root-urls).

<SiteSpecific>
The root URL for this deployment is `%root_url%`.
</SiteSpecific>
<SiteSpecific showIfNotSet={['root_url']}>
If you are already working with a Taskcluster deployment, use the scheme and hostname of that page as the root URL.
In fact, you can find a version of this tutorial specifically tailored to that deployment at `/docs/tutorial` on that root URL.
The Firefox CI deployment is publicly viewable, and you are welcome to explore it; its root URL is https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com.
Failing that, check in with the [Taskcluster developers](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#taskcluster:mozilla.org) to get access to a deployment where you can experiment.
