# Features

Features are services provided by docker-worker that give tasks additional
functionality and in some cases the ability to communicate with external
resources that would otherwise be unavailable.

These features are enabled by declaring them within the task payload in the
`features` object.

Note: Some features require additional information within the task definition.
Consult the documentation for each feature to understand the requirements.

Example:

```js
{
  "payload": {
    "features": {
      "exampleFeature": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Feature: `taskclusterProxy`

The taskcluster proxy provides an easy and safe way to make authenticated
taskcluster requests within the scope(s) of a particular task.  The proxy
accepts un-authenticated requests and attaches credentials to them
corresponding to `task.scopes` as well as scopes to upload artifacts.

The proxy's rootUrl is available to tasks in the environment variable
`TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL`.  It can be used with a client like this:

```js
var taskcluster = require('@taskcluster/client');
var queue = new taskcluster.Queue({
  rootUrl: process.env.TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL,
});
queue.createTask(..);
```

This request would require that `task.scopes` contain the appropriate
`queue:create-task:..` scope for the `createTask` API call.

*NOTE*: as a special case, the scopes required to call
`queue.createArtifact(<taskId>, <runId>, ..)` are automatically included,
regardless of `task.scopes`.

The proxy is easy to use within a shell command, too:

```sh
curl $TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_URL/api/secrets/v1/secret/my-top-secret-secret
```

This invocation would require `secrets:get:my-top-secret-secret` in `task.scopes`.

## Feature: `interactive`

Allows ssh-like access to running containers. Will extend the lifetime of a task to allow a user to SSH in before the container dies, so be careful when using this feature. Will also keep the task alive while is connected and a little bit after that so a user can keep working in ssh after the task ends.

Example:

```js
{
  "payload": {
    "features": {
      "interactive": true
    },
  }
}
```
Then click on the `interactive.html` in the UI to enter the container.

## Feature: `allowPtrace`

Status: stable

This feature allows tasks to use the ptrace(2) syscall.
The Firefox crash reporter, for example, requires this functionality.

The feature accomplishes its magic by creating a task-specific AppArmor profile that allows any process in the profile to trace any other process in the profile.
While this should be safe, assuming that all processes in the task container are at an equal privilege level, it is a deviation from the Docker security model and thus should be used with caution.

The task needs `docker-worker:feature:allowPtrace` scope to run with this feature enabled.
