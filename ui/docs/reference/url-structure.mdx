# URL Structure

This section describes the structure of URLs used to access a Taskcluster deployment.

## RootUrl

A Taskcluster [`rootUrl`](/docs/manual/using/root-urls) is a partial web address containing at least the scheme, host, and optionally a port. It cannot specify a path.

<SiteSpecific>
The root URL for this deployment is `%root_url%`.
</SiteSpecific>
<SiteSpecific showIfNotSet={['root_url']}>
For example, a company's root URL might be `https://taskcluster.example.com`.
</SiteSpecific>

Normally, a rootUrl has no trailing `/` characters.
We suggest that libraries and tools be lenient and accept rootUrls containing a trailing `/`, but normalize to produce rootUrls without a trailing `/`.

## URLs

Taskcluster uses URLs with the following patterns:

| destination | URL Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Rest API method | `<rootUrl>/api/<service>/<version>/<path>` |
| Documentation | `<rootUrl>/docs/<path>` |
| JSON-Schemas | `<rootUrl>/schemas/<path>` |
| [API References](/docs/manual/design/apis/reference-format) | `<rootUrl>/references/<path>` |
| UI | `<rootUrl>/<path>` (for anything not matching above)|

For example, the v1 Index method [`insertTask`](/docs/reference/core/index/api#insertTask) describes route `/task/<namespace>`, so a call to this method with rootURl `https://tc.example.com` and namespace `product.release.latest` would have full URL `https://tc.example.com/api/index/v1/task/product.release.latest`.

*NOTE*: All of the Taskcluster clients construct API URLs for you.  Taskcluster also provides a [taskcluster-lib-urls](https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-lib-urls) library in several languages to support generation of these URLs.
