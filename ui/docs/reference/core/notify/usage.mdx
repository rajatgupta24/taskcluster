# Enable Notifications

This service can also be used via a simple api, if you have the correct scopes.

There are four types of notifications and four types of filters possible on these notifications.

### Notification Types

__Email:__ We can you both nicely formatted or plain text emails depending on which email client you want to use. You can send to any email address, so long as you have the correct scopes (we'll discuss scopes later).

<SiteSpecific>
This deployment sends notification emails from `%notify_email_sender%`.
</SiteSpecific>

__Pulse:__ We can also send a Pulse message that is documented [on this page](/docs/reference/core/notify/exchanges). The message is  pretty much just the status of the task.

__Matrix:__ If a deployment of taskcluster is configured with credentials for a Matrix instance, it can post to Matrix rooms. *Note: The taskcluster user must be invited to a room before it can post there*

<SiteSpecific>
This deployment uses a Matrix bot with username `%notify_matrix_bot_name%`.
</SiteSpecific>

__Slack:__ If a Taskcluster deployment has Slack credentials, you can post to it likewise. *Note: Either the Slack App must be invited to channels, or granted `chat:write.public` and be posting to a public channel.*

<SiteSpecific>
This deployment uses a Slack bot with username `%notify_slack_bot_name%`.
</SiteSpecific>

### Filters

You can read more in the queue documentation to understand exactly what different
task states exist.

__on-any:__ (DEPRECATED) This does what it sounds like and will notify you of task-completion no matter how it ends. Unless the task was deliberately canceled.

__on-transition:__ As the task changes states (defined -> pending -> running -> resolved) this will send a notification for each one.

__on-resolved:__ This replaces the old `on-any` filter and will send a notification on any of the end-states of a task (completed, failed and exception)

__on-defined:__ When the task is defined you will get a notification.

__on-pending:__ When the task is pending you will get a notification.

__on-running:__ When the task is running you will get a notification.

__on-completed:__ Only when the task completes with no errors will you get a notification.

__on-failed:__ Only when the task fails for non-internal reasons will this be triggered. This could be your tests failing or a lint step failing, as examples.

__on-exception:__ This is triggered when the task didn't run due to some exception such as internal error, timeouts, deadlines, malformed-payload. Some exceptions can be ignored, using the `ignoreTaskReasonResolved` configuration parameter.  By default, this parameter contains `canceled` and `deadline-exceeded`.

More thorough (and more correct) documentation of task exception `reasonResolved` codes can be found [on the docs site](/docs/reference/platform/queue/api#status).

### Route Syntax

But what you've really been waiting for is to know how to use this, so here's a simple set of routes that will do some of the things you might want.

```json
{
  "routes": [
    "notify.email.<you@you.com>.on-resolved",
    "notify.pulse.<a-pulse-routing-key>.on-exception",
    "notify.matrix-room.<a-matrix-roomId>.on-resolved",
    "notify.slack-channel.<a-slack-channelId>.on-resolved"
  ]
}
```

The `roomId` referenced by matrix is a full `!foo:bar.com` including the leading `!`.

The `channelId` referenced by the Slack integration is the unique channel ID. If you copy a link to a channel, the
channel ID will be the last URL segment. Public channels start with a capital C.

### Setting Custom Messages

In matrix and email you can set custom messages by adding fields to your task definition. The fields will be rendered with [jsone](https://json-e.js.org/)
given a context of the [task definition](/docs/reference/platform/queue/api#get-task-definition)
and the `status` section of [task status](/docs/reference/platform/queue/references/events#message-payload-4).
The task definition is in the context under the key `task` and the status is in the context under the key `status`. `taskId` and `rootUrl` are also provided.
The matrix fields are defined in detail in the matrix specification.
The fields you add to your task definition are all in the `task.extra` section under a key `notify`. They are as follows:

__task.extra.notify.matrixBody:__ This is a simple text message suitable to be rendered by any matrix client

__task.extra.notify.matrixFormattedBody:__ This is a rich message suitable to be rendered by capable matrix clients. Matrix will fall back to `matrixBody` if not supported.

__task.extra.notify.matrixFormat:__ The format for `formattedBody`. For instance, `org.matrix.custom.html`

__task.extra.notify.matrixMsgtype:__ Which matrix `m.room.message` msgtype to use. Note that it is `Msgtype` and not `msgType` to match matrix naming scheme. Defaults to `m.notice`.

__task.extra.notify.slackText:__ The simple text message which will be posted to the Slack channel. This field supports markdown.

__task.extra.notify.slackBlocks:__ [Slack Blocks](https://api.slack.com/reference/block-kit/blocks) formatted content for the message. By default, blocks are rendered which include
the `slackText`. If this is specified, `slackText` is only used for fallback rendering.

__task.extra.notify.slackAttachments:__ Extra [Slack Attachments](https://api.slack.com/reference/messaging/attachments) which are displayed below the message. These are usually used for context.
No attachments are rendered by default.

__task.extra.notify.email.content:__ This should evaluate to a markdown string and is the body of an email

__task.extra.notify.email.subject:__ This should evaluate to a normal string and is the subject of an email

__task.extra.notify.email.link:__ This should evaluate to an object with `text` (which will be the text on the button) and `href` keys or null if you do not want a link in your email

__task.extra.notify.email.template:__ This should evaluate to string with a value of either 'simple' or 'fullscreen' at this time


### Scopes

If you're using this from the api instead of via a task definition, you'll need some simple ``notify.<type>.*`` scopes of some sort. The specific ones you need are documented on the [api docs](/docs/reference/core/notify/api).

The `roomId` referenced by matrix is a full `!foo:bar.com` including the leading `!`.

If you're using this via task definitions, access to notifications is guarded with route scopes. As an example, to allow the taskcluster-github project to email and ping in matrix when builds complete, it has the scopes

```
queue:route:notify.email.*
queue:route:notify.matrix-room.*
```

### Example

Finally, an example to tie it all together. This is the as-of-this-writing ``.taskcluster.yml`` of the aforementioned taskcluster-github project.


```yaml
taskQueueId: tutorial/docker-worker
routes:
  - "notify.email.user@example.com.on-resolved"
  - "notify.matrix-room.!whDRjjSmICCgrhFHsQ:mozilla.org.on-failed"
  - "notify.matrix-room.!whDRjjSmICCgrhFHsQ:mozilla.org.on-exception"
extra:
  notify:
    email:
      content: 'Things worked in ${status.taskId}',
  github:
    env: true
    events:
      - pull_request.opened
      - pull_request.synchronize
      - pull_request.reopened
      - push
payload:
  maxRunTime: 3600
  image: "node:5"
  command: ...
metadata:
  name: "Taskcluster GitHub Tests"
  description: "All non-integration tests"
  owner: "user@example.com"
  source: "https://git.example.com"
```
