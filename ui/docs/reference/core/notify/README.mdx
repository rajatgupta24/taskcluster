# Notify Service

No longer will you need to keep going back to the task-inspector page to know if your task is complete!
Merely add some routes and we will tell you when your task is done!
<Warning>You'll need to have the appropriate scopes to add these routes.</Warning>

Example routes:

```json
"routes": [
  "notify.email.<you@you.com>.on-resolved",
  "notify.pulse.<a-pulse-routing-key>.on-exception",
  "notify.matrix-room.<a-matrix-roomId>.on-resolved",
  "notify.slack-channel.<a-slack-channelId>.on-resolved"
]
```

However All notifications are transmitted via pulse and should not be considered private.
Further specification of this is contained in the [usage docs](/docs/reference/core/notify/usage).

<Warning>The channel should have the # preceeding it.</Warning>
